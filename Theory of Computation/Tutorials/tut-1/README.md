# Tutorial 1 :  Basics of Set Theory & PMI, Strong PMI

1. Suppose A and B are sets. Give venn diagram to represent (A-B) U (B-A) U (A ∩ B) and using same, find simple expression.
	> A U B
	
2. Give truth table and find simple statement for P ∨ ¬( P → Q)
	> P
	
3. What is the relationship between 2^{A U B} and 2^A U 2^B .
	

	- [Extra] What is the relationship between 2A ∪ B and 2A ∪ 2B .
4. Show that for any language L, L* = (L*)* =(L+)* =(L*)+
	- L+ is a subset of L*.

5. Find relation between L1(L2 ∩ L3) and L1L2 ∩ L1L3
	> Both are equal. *can be proved by example*
6. Prove that for every n ≥ 0, ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑖2 = 𝑛(𝑛 + 1)(2𝑛 + 1)/6
	> Through PMI
7. Prove that for any string x, |xr| = |x|
	> Through PMI
8. Give recursive definitions of each of the following sets.
a. The set N of all natural numbers.
b. The set S of all integers divisible by 7.
c. The set U of all strings in {0,1}* containing the substring 00.
