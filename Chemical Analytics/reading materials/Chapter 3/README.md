- ## Applications of Infrared Spectroscopy
	1. Identification of substance
	Infrared spectroscopy is used to establish whether a given sample or an organic substance is identical with another or not like : Alkanes, Alkenes, Alkynes, Aromatic ring etc.
	2. Determination of Molecular structure
	Infrared spectroscopy is helpful in determining molecular structure of unknown substance.
	From an examination of the position of absorption band in the spectrum.it is possible to establish the nature of the gas groups present in the molecule.
	3. Detection of impurities.
	4. Isomerism in organic chemistry
	5. Identification of functional groups
	6. Miscellaneous Examples
		- The following are some important application :
		a. Determination of purity
		b. Shape of symmetry of a molecule.
		c. Presence of water in a sample.
		d. Measurement of paints And varnishes
