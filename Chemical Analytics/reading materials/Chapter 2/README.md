- ## history of spectroscopy
	- spectrum : rainbow of colours
	- discovery of electrojagnetic waves other than light, discovery of infrared light.
	- temprature of different colors by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism
	- spectroscopy plays significant role in `chemistry`, `physics` and `astronomy`

- ## Spectroscopy
	- branch of science that deals with the study of interaction of `matter` with `light`
	- branch of science that deals with the study of interaction of `electromagnetic radiation` [**EMR**] with `matter`.
	- powerful tool for study of atomic and molecular structure
	- used in the analysis of a wide range of samples
	
	> radiation contains both wave and partical nature.
	
	> ----[WAVE , radiation, hv]----> [SAMPLE] ----> [DETECTOR]
	
	> Intensity vs Wavelength graph shows the change in the structure of the molecule wrt intensity changes by showing drip in the graph.
	
- ## Principle of Spectroscopy
	- Interaction of matter with light
	- whenever matter interacts with light, it either absorps or emits the light.

	- **1. Absorption Spectroscopy**
		- absops the light energy
		- measurement of absoption of electromagnetic radition.
			- UV (185-400 nm) spectroscopy
			- visible (400-800 nm) spectroscopy
			- IR (0.76-15 μm) spectroscopy
		- **1.1. Atomic Spectroscopy**
			- concerned with the interaction of EMR with Atoms
			- commonly in lower energy state called grown state
			- high energy/intensity that it can go upto ATOM.
		- **1.2. Molecular Spectroscopy**
			- concerned with the interaction of EMR with Molecule
				- UV (185-400 nm) spectroscopy
				- visible (400-800 nm) spectroscopy
				- IR (0.76-15 μm) spectroscopy
			- low energy/intensity that it can go upto Molecule.
	- **2. Emission Spectroscopy**
		- emits the light energy
		- emission is dispersed *(split up)* according to some property of the emission
		- amount dispersion is measured.
		- i.e. Mass spectroscopy.
