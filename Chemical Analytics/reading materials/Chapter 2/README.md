[Ultraviolet Spectroscopy youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRYyI2dOW5q0crC8Dgf7UwcuFk9FVb3kP)

- ## history of spectroscopy
	- spectrum : rainbow of colours
	- discovery of electrojagnetic waves other than light, discovery of infrared light.
	- temprature of different colors by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism
	- spectroscopy plays significant role in `chemistry`, `physics` and `astronomy`

- ## Spectroscopy
	- branch of science that deals with the study of interaction of `matter` with `light`
	- branch of science that deals with the study of interaction of `electromagnetic radiation` [**EMR**] with `matter`.
	- powerful tool for study of atomic and molecular structure
	- used in the analysis of a wide range of samples
	
	> radiation contains both wave and partical nature.
	
	> ----[WAVE , radiation, hv]----> [SAMPLE] ----> [DETECTOR]
	
	> Intensity vs Wavelength graph shows the change in the structure of the molecule wrt intensity changes by showing drip in the graph.
	
- ## Principle of Spectroscopy
	- Interaction of matter with light
	- whenever matter interacts with light, it either absorps or emits the light.

	- **1. Absorption Spectroscopy**
		- absops the light energy
		- measurement of absoption of electromagnetic radition.
			- UV (185-400 nm) spectroscopy
			- visible (400-800 nm) spectroscopy
			- IR (0.76-15 μm) spectroscopy
		- **1.1. Atomic Spectroscopy**
			- concerned with the interaction of EMR with Atoms
			- commonly in lower energy state called grown state
			- high energy/intensity that it can go upto ATOM.
		- **1.2. Molecular Spectroscopy**
			- concerned with the interaction of EMR with Molecule
				- UV (185-400 nm) spectroscopy
				- visible (400-800 nm) spectroscopy
				- IR (0.76-15 μm) spectroscopy
			- low energy/intensity that it can go upto Molecule.
	- **2. Emission Spectroscopy**
		- emits the light energy
		- emission is dispersed *(split up)* according to some property of the emission
		- amount dispersion is measured.
		- i.e. Mass spectroscopy.
	
## Problems based on EMR
	
- The highest surface part of a wave is called the **crest**, and the lowest part is the **trough**. The vertical distance between the crest and the trough is the **wave height**. The horizontal distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is known as the **wavelength**.
- EMR : particle + waves

- wavenumber = 1/wavelength
- E = hc/λ
- f = c/λ
- 1 erg = 1e-7 joule
- 1 calorie = 4.18 joule
- to give answer in mole<sup>-1</sup> : multiply it with **6.023 x 10<sup>23</sup>**
- to get answer in calorie from joule : divide joule value with **4.18**
- to get answer in joule from calorie : multiply calorie value with **4.18**
- to get answer in 1 ev : divide joule value with **1.602 x 10<sup>-19</sup>**

## Electromagnetic Spectrum
- RMI VU XG
- EMR falls on matter : certain transition takes place.
- energy level : ground state, excited stage

- **Electronic Energy Levels**
	- room temperature : molecules are in the lowest energy energy levels E<sub>0</sub>
	- absorbs UV visible light from EMR, outermost bond/lone-pair electron is promoted to higher energy state (E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, ... E<sub>n</sub>)
	- ΔE = hv = E<sub>n</sub> - E<sub>0</sub> where *(n=1,2,3... etc.)*
	- Electronic fields : 
		- Rotational electronic fields
		- Vibrational electronic fields
	
	- `ΔE<sub>electronic</sub>` > `ΔE<sub>vibrational</sub>` > `ΔE<sub>rotational</sub>`
