- ## history of spectroscopy
	- spectrum : rainbow of colours
	- discovery of electrojagnetic waves other than light, discovery of infrared light.
	- temprature of different colors by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism
	- spectroscopy plays significant role in `chemistry`, `physics` and `astronomy`

- ## Spectroscopy
	- branch of science that deals with the study of interaction of `matter` with `light`
	- branch of science that deals with the study of interaction of `electromagnetic radiation` [**EMR**] with `matter`.
	- powerful tool for study of atomic and molecular structure
	- used in the analysis of a wide range of samples
	
	> radiation contains both wave and partical nature.
	
	> ----[WAVE , radiation, hv]----> [SAMPLE] ----> [DETECTOR]
	
	> Intensity vs Wavelength graph shows the change in the structure of the molecule wrt intensity changes by showing drip in the graph.
