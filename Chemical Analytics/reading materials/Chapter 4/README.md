# Thermal Analysis

- ## Thermal Method of Analysis
	- branch of analytical science where *properties of analysis are studied as they change with temperature*
	- **Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)**
		- Experimental technique in which the mass of a sample is measured as function of sample temperature or time.
	- sample is typically
		- heated at a *constant heating rate* **[Dynamic measurement]** or
		- held at a *constant temperature* **[Isothermal measurement]**
	- results of a TGA measurement :
		- displayed as a TGA curve
		- mass or % mass is plotted against temperature.
		
- ## TGA basics
	- measures changes in weight in relation to changes in temperature
	- measured weight loss curve gives information about : 
		- **changes in** sample **composition**
		- **thermal stability**
		- **kinetic parameters** for chemical reactions in the sample
	- derivative weight loss curve used to tell the point at which weight loss is most apparent/obvious/clear.

- ## Several methods for analysis
	| Method | Quality measured |
	|---|---|
	| Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) | **mass** |
	| Differential thermal analysis (DTA) | **temperature difference** |
	| Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) | **heat difference** |
	| Pressurized TGA (PTGA) | **mass changes as function of pressure** |
	| Thermo mechanical analysis (TMA) | **deformations and dimension** |
	| Dilatometry (DIL) | **volume** |
	| Evolved gas analysis (EGA) | **gaseous decomposition products** |
	
	- different properties may be measured at the same time : TGA-DTA, TGA-EGA
		
- ## Mechanisms of weight change in TGA
	> all are kinetic process (there is a rate at which these occurs)
	- weight loss : *{DERD}*
		- Decomposition - breaking apart of chemical bonds
		- Evaporation - loss of volatiles with elevated temperature
		- Reduction - interaction of sample to a reducing atmosphere
			- hydrogen, ammonia etc.
		- Desorption - release of an absorbed substance from a surface
	- weight gain : *{OA}*
		- Oxidation - interaction of the sample with an oxidizing atmosphere
		- Absorption / Adsorption : soaking up/ solid holds molecule of liquid or gas as a thin film.
		
- ## TGA phenomena causing mass changes
	- physical 
		- gas adsorption
		- gas desorption
		- phase transitions
			- vaporization
			- sublimation
	- chemical
		- decomposition
		- break down reactions
		- gas reactions
		- chemisorption
	
- ## Applications of TGA
	- characterization of 
		- thermal **stability** 
		- material **purity**
		- determination of **humidity**
	- Examination of 
		- **corrosion** studies
		- **gasification** processes
		- **kinetic** processes
		
	- principle uses of TGA : measurement of a materia's **thermal stability** and its **composition**

		- Plasticizer content of polymers

		- Performance of stabilizers
		- Low molecular weight monomers in polymers
		
	- what TGA can tell you : *{TOC LD RM}*

- ## Factors affecting the TG curve
	- Increases the **temperature** at which sample decomposition occurs
		- Heating rate
		- Sample size
	- Affects the **progress** of thier reaction
		- Particle size of sample
		- Packing
		- Crucible shape
		- Gas flow rate
- ## Types of TGA
	- Dynamic TGA
		- sample is subjected to conditions of **continuous incrase in temperature** ususally linear with time
	- Isothermal or static TGA
		- sample is maintained at a **constant temperature** for a period of time during which any change in weight are noted

- ## Principle of TGA
	- gradually raising the temperature of a sample
		> in a furnace *as it's*
	- weight is measured on an analytical balance
		> that remains outside of the furnace.
	- mass loss is observed if a thermal event involves loss of a volatile component
	- Cumbustion like chemical reactions involves mass losses
		> Melting like physical changes do not involve mass loss.
	- weight of the sample is plotted against temperature or time
		- to illustrate thermal transitions in the material
		- loss of solvent and plasticizers in polymers, water of hydration in inorganic materials.
		- curve called thermogravimetric curve or thermogram
	- decomposition of material

- ## Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
	- *measures* the difference in heat flow (mW = mJ/sec)
	- *between* sample and inert reference 
	- as a *function* of time and temperature
	
	
	- relies on the measurement of the difference between 
		- the heat flow vs. temperature relation of the **sample**
		- the heat flow vs. temperature relation of a **standard**
	
	- types of calorimeters and criteria for classification
		- ranges of temperatures, pressure range
			- high temp/pressure or low temp/pressure
		- type of the test process
			- measure heat of mixing, heat capacity
		- thermodynamic conditions
			- adiabatic, non-adabatic
			> adiabatic : relating to or denoting a process or condition in which heat does not enter or leave the system concerned.
		- sample weight change during the measurement
			- open (mass transfer/exchange)
			- closed (no mass transfer)
	
- ## Types of DSC
	- Flow (Heat flux DSC)
		- directly measured signal is a change in temperature between a test sample and a reference sample
		- difference is proportional to the flow of the heat flux between the two samples
		- automatically converted to the value of the heat flux using special software.
		- **heat flux remains constant**
	- Compensation (Power compensation DSC)
		- consist of two identical and isolated heaters located in the same temperature
			> one in tested sample, another in reference sample
		- Temperature changes during the phase transformation or the reaction in the sample are compensated by varying the electrical energy supplied to the heater
		- its directly proportional to the heat absorbed during the process
		- **power supply remains constant**
	
	> ![Types of DCS](./assets/types-of-dsc.png)
	
- result of calorimetric measurements is a DSC curve shown as the temperature / time dependence on the heat flux (per time unit)
	- temperature<sub>tested</sub> < temperature<sub>reference</sub> during phase transformation/reaction, HEAT IS ABSORBED. situation is registered as **ENDOTHERMIC PEAK**.
	- sample temperature is higher, and there is separation of the heat : **EXOTHERMIC PEAK**.
	
- ## DSC Heat flow
	- dH/dt = Cp DT/dt
		- dH : DSC heat flow signal
		- Cp : Sample Heat Capacity
			- sample specific heat x sample weight
		- dT/dt : heating rate

	- Heat flows into the sample as a result of either 
		- heat capacity (heating)
		- glass transition 
		- melting
		- evaporation
		- other endothermic processes
	- Heat flows out of the sample as a result of either
		- heat capacity (cooling)
		- cystallization
		- curing
		- oxidation
		- other exothermic processes
	
- ## Enthalpy of transition
	- area under the peaks in the curve can be use to calculate the enthalpy of transition
	- ∆𝐻 = 𝐾𝐴
		- ∆𝐻 = Change in Enthalpy
	
		- K = calorimetric Constant
		- A = Area under the peak (by integration of peak)

	- Area under the peak is directly proportional to the heat evolved or absorbed in a reaction. 
	- Height of the peak represents the rate of reaction.

	- DSC measurements can be made in two ways: by measuring the electrical energy provided to heaters below the pans necessary to maintain the two pans at the same temperature (power compensation), or by measuring the heat flow (differential temperature) as a function of sample temperature (heat flux). The DSC ultimately outputs the differential heat flow (heat/time) between your material and the empty reference pan. Heat capacity may be determined by taking the ratio of heat flow to heating rate. Thus,
	- C<sub>p</sub> = q/∆T
	- where Cp is the material’s heat capacity, q is the heat flow through the material over a given time, and ∆T is the change in temperature over that same time.
