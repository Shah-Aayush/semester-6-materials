- Capital Strucutre
	- Net income approach
		- equity = PAT/Ke
		- debentures = Interest/Kd
		- market value of firm = equity + debentures
		
	- Net operating income approach
		- value of unleavered firm = PBIT(1-t)/Ke
		- value of leavered firm = unleavered firm value + debt(1-t)

- Leverage
	- DOL 
		- PBIT/sales
		- DOL = contribution/PBIT
			> sales - VC = contribution ; contri - FC = PBIT;
	- DFL
		- EPS/PBIT
			> EPS = profit/no. of shares
				> PBIT - interest = PBT; PBT - taxes = PAT; PAT - pref. div. = profit
		- PBIT/( PBIT - int - (pref.div/(1-t)) )

- Risk and Return
	- individual return
	- expected return
	- expected risk
	- expected return with prob.
	- expected risk with prob.
	- with weighted risk , return
	
- Capital Asset pricing model
	- Return of portfolio : Rp = Rf + B(Rm - Rf)
	- B = COV(i,m)/(sigma m)^2
	- sigma M^2 = (B * sigma M) ^2 + sigma ^ 2
	- regression line
	- prportion explnation : r^2 -> can be explained; 1-r^2 cannot be explained
	
- Capital Budgeting
	- Payback period
	- Discounted payback period
	- NPV
	- Profitability index
	- IRR calculation
		- avg cash flow = total cash flow/no of years
		- PVIFA = initial investment/avg cash flow
		- years | CF | PVIF @ | PV of CF cumulative
		- NPV : cumulative total - investment
		- NPV : + - : i + - (4)
		> IRR : lower rate + diff b/w two rates (PV @ lower rate - Initial investment)/(PV @ lower rate - PV @ higher rate)
		- Modified IRR
		
- Cost of Capital 
	- debentures
		- irredemable debentures : (int (1-t) 100) / v
		- redemable debentures : [int (1-t) + F-P/N]/((F+P)/2)
	- term loan 
		- kt = Int * (1-t)
	- preference shares
		- cost of capital = irredemable pref shares : kp = div/p0 * 100
		- redemable pref shares : kp = [ ( div + F-P/N )/ (F+P)/2] * 100
	- equity
		- divident model
			- ke = [D1/p0 + g] *100
			
		- earning model
			- ke = eps/p0 *100

	- CAP model 
		- ke = rf + b(rm-rf)
	
- Cash management
	- baumol model
		- marketable securities c = (2bt/i)^1/2
	- miller and orr model	
		- return point rp = (3b sigma^2/4i)^1/3 + LL
		- UL = 3rp - 2LL
	
- Dividend model
	- EPS = PAT/ no. of shares
	- walters model P = ( div + (r/ke)*(eps - div) ) / ke
	- dividend = EPS * D/P Ratio
	- gordons model = EPS (1-b)/(EPS - br)
	- d/p = 1-b

- Working capital management
	- OC = ICP + ACP/ARP
	- CCC = OC - APP
	- inventory conversion period = avg inventory*360/cogs
		- avg inventory = operating + closing inventory /2
	- Accounts receivable period = avg debtors(/receivables) * 360/credit sales
		- avg debt = op. debt + closing debt /2
		- credit sales = total sales - cash sales
	- Account payable period = avg creditors (avg payable) * 360 /cogs
		- avg creditors = op balance + cl balance /2

Objectives of Financial Management
The financial management is generally concerned with procurement, allocation and control of financial resources of a concern. The objectives can be-

To ensure regular and adequate supply of funds to the concern.
To ensure adequate returns to the shareholders which will depend upon the earning capacity, market price of the share, expectations of the shareholders.
To ensure optimum funds utilization. Once the funds are procured, they should be utilized in maximum possible way at least cost.
To ensure safety on investment, i.e, funds should be invested in safe ventures so that adequate rate of return can be achieved.
To plan a sound capital structure-There should be sound and fair composition of capital so that a balance is maintained between debt and equity capital.
