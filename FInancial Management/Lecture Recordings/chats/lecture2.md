SHETH DHRUVI4:48 PM
a
SANGHVI HARSHIL4:49 PM
initially B looks attractive because we don't see calculated amount. we just see high amount in hand and find it attractive
RUSHIR MANOJ4:49 PM
option a is feasible , as PV is 6150 for the lumpsum , hence getting 10k for 15yrs amounts to 150000 is much better
SHETH DHRUVI4:49 PM
He expects to live for 15 yrs so 15 *10K
SHAH KANISHA4:49 PM
66667 for a option
hence more feasible
